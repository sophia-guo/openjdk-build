about: No sure where to raise the issue?

Unsure where to raise something? Here are some of the common places:
- If your issue is due to the way OpenJDK is built, then this is the repository to raise it in - Describe your problem below
- If your issue is related to our installers (as opposed to tgz/zip downloads) raise it in [openjdk-installer](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-installer/)
- If your issue is related to and end-user visible issue with the JDK, or an underlying java bug, please raise it in [openjdk-support](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-support/issues)
- Otherwise, take a look at our TSC repository directory [here](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/TSC/#dependent-projects). If you're still not sure then join our [slack channel[(http://adoptopenjdk.net/slack) and ask on `#general`
